<b>Peer-assessment</b>
<br/>Peer-assessments are assessments that are corrected by peers. It is important to distinguish peer-assessments in the context of having students correct each others works and peer-assessments to evaluate teammates in the context of group-work. Peer corrected work create opportunities for student to see solutions, approaches and mistakes that differ from their own offering them other perspectives on a problem.
