<b>Fairness</b>
<br/>Fairness is about how to best enable students to demonstrate their capacities. A fair test will not present disadvantages to students from different culture or gender. It also includes modifying the testing conditions to compensate for handicaps, such as allotting extra time to students with dyslexia.
