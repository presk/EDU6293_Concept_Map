<b>Reliability</b>
<br/>In classical test theory it is defined as the level of random errors in a test (Raykov & Macoulides, 2011). It is usually evaluated by using Cronbach’s alpha. In a more general context, it is defined as an assessment’s consistency, the extent to which it measures what it is intended to measure (Andrade & Heritage, 2017).
