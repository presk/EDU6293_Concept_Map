<b>Performance Criteria (What needs to be done)</b>
<br/>Performance criteria define what the students are required to do to reach the learning goals. It can also consist of the list of steps that need to be mastered to complete a task to demonstrate learning. Say the learning goal is to master the basics of Object-Oriented Programming, the performance criteria then consists of concepts such as polymorphism, aggregation, attributes, objects, relationships, classes, abstracts, etc. Ideally presented in a list format in chronological order:
<br/>1.	Creating a Class
<br/>2.	Defining Attributes
<br/>3.	Defining the Constructor
<br/>4.	Etc.
