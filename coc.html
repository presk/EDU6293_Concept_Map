<b>Co-constructed criteria </b>
<br/>Co-construction of criteria consist of allowing students to participate in the creation of criteria when designing an assessment. In fact, high-level cognitive engagement via the co-construction of criteria and careful self-assessment is related to learning and achievement (Andrade & Heritage, 2017). Co-constructimg criteria helps students better understand the requirement to complete an assignment since they participated in deciding what will be evaluated. An example of such activity would be creating an assignement such as asking students to create a banking system and let them create all the use cases and build criteria to evaluate them.
