<br/>Product criteria add a level of specificity to performance criteria because they articulate on the qualities or characteristics of a studentâ€™s work for each criterion (Andrade & Heritage, 2017). In other words, if there is a performance criterion on code comments, then a product criteria would compare different levels of commenting such as cleanliness, importance, understandability, and presence.
