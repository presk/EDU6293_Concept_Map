<b>Self-efficacy</b>
<br/>Motivation is better described as a duality: intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. 
<br/>Extrinsic motivation is defined as motivation that stems from the outside, often associated to the carrot and the stick or incentive.
On the other hand, intrinsic motivation stems from the person itself where doing a task provides inherent satisfaction or enjoyment. (Eccles & Wigfield, 2020)
