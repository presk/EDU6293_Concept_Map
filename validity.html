<b>Validity</b>
<br/>In classical test theory it is defined as the level of random errors in a test (Raykov & Macoulides, 2011). It is usually evaluated by repeat testing then measuring the error. In a more general context, it is defined as an assessmentâ€™s quality, the extent to which it provides accurate information (Andrade & Heritage, 2017).
