<b>Self-efficacy</b>
<br/><p>“Self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in his or her capacity to execute behaviors necessary to produce specific performance attainments “(Bandura, 1997). In other words, it is important to make sure your students believe in their capacity to learn the subject, because self-efficacy is a precursor to success (Andrade & Heritage, 2017).
