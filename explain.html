<b>Explaining</b>
<br/>Explaining is similar to telling but takes it a step further and consists of providing a logical train of thought combined with the necessary information. For example, instead of simply telling a student to use the synchronized keywords when using threads it is better to explain how locks work and what the synchronized keyword does.
