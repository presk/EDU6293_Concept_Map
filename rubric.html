<b>Rubric </b>
<br/>A rubric is similar to a checklist as it is a list of criteria, but it has levels of quality for each criterion (Brookhart, 2013). They can be useful to evaluate nontechnical skills such as commenting and optimization. Here is an example:

<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <th>Criteria</th>
        <th>2</th>
        <th>1</th>
        <th>0</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Optimization</td>
        <td>Code executes in &lt;O(logn)</td>
        <td>=O(logn)</td>
        <td>&gt;(logn)</td>
    </tr>  
</table>
